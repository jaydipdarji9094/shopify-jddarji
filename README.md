This repository provides instructions to set up and run a Shopify theme locally using the Shopify CLI.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed on your machine:

* **Node.js**: v18.20+, or v20.10+
* **Package Manager**: `npm`, `Yarn` (1.x), or `pnpm`
* **Git**: v2.28.0 or higher
* **Ruby** (for some CLI features):

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full

## üöÄ Installation Steps

### 1. Install Shopify CLI globally

```bash
npm install -g @shopify/cli@latest
```

> Alternatively, you can install via `yarn` or `pnpm`:
>
> ```bash
> yarn global add @shopify/cli
> # or
> pnpm add -g @shopify/cli

### 2. Connect to your Shopify store

Use the following command to start developing your theme locally. Replace `your-store-url` with your store‚Äôs domain (e.g., `my-store.myshopify.com`):

```bash
shopify theme dev --store=your-store-url
```

This will:

* Authenticate with your Shopify admin
* Pull your theme files (if needed)
* Start a local development server with hot reloading
* Open your theme preview in the browser
