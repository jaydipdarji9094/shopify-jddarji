# Shopify Theme Development - Local Setup Guide

This repository provides instructions to set up and run a Shopify theme locally using the Shopify CLI.

---

## ✅ Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed on your machine:

* **Node.js**: v18.20+, or v20.10+
* **Package Manager**: `npm`, `Yarn` (1.x), or `pnpm`
* **Git**: v2.28.0 or higher
* **Ruby** (for some CLI features):

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full
```

---

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### 1. Install Shopify CLI globally

```bash
npm install -g @shopify/cli@latest
```

> Alternatively, you can install via `yarn` or `pnpm`:
>
> ```bash
> yarn global add @shopify/cli
> # or
> pnpm add -g @shopify/cli
> ```

---

### 2. Connect to your Shopify store

Use the following command to start developing your theme locally. Replace `your-store-url` with your store’s domain (e.g., `my-store.myshopify.com`):

```bash
shopify theme dev --store=your-store-url
```

This will:

* Authenticate with your Shopify admin
* Pull your theme files (if needed)
* Start a local development server with hot reloading
* Open your theme preview in the browser

## 💡 Tips

* For better dev experience, use [Shopify Dawn](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn) as a base theme.

* You can set the store permanently using:

  ```bash
  shopify config set --store your-store-url
  ```

* Add `.env` file to store credentials securely (if needed for CI/CD).
